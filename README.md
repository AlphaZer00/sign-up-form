# sign-up-form

This was an exercise to play with forms and client-side validation. 

I've also begun to consider screen size more when styling websites. I often have browser tabs open sized to half of the screen so I included an alternate layout for screen widths under 1000px that moves the image from the side of the screen to the top. That way I could have the browser sized to half of my screen without the input area and text being resized super thin and hard to read.
